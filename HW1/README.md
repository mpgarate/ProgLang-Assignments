## Problem 3

```
a:Int                       because
                            1:Int

b:(Int, Int)                because
                            x: Int
                            3: Int

(b, 1):((Int, Int), Int)    because
                            b: (Int, Int)
                            1: Int
(b, a + 2): ((Int, Int))
